# Anti-AI Discord Bot

Anti-AI is a Discord bot that automatically deletes any messages sent to any channel in your server by the
Discord AI image manipulation apps:

* @Viggle
* @Glifbot
* @InsightFaceSwap

This prevents users who attempt to use them from receiving the results of the AI app's manipulations.
It also _seems_ to prevent the bot from actually performing the image manipulation task in the first place, since
it never sends its followup message with the results.
